                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)
                          at Dream University &amp; Technology (KUET) offers
                          unique opportunities for education, research and
                          innovation to meet the increasing demand for highly
                          educated engineering professionals. Now, the EEE
                          faculty has grown beyond expectations and is
                          consistently ranked among the top Engineering
                          faculties of Bangladesh. Since its inception, the EEE
                          faculty at KUET has been active in recruiting
                          outstanding new faculty members to support its
                          teaching and research activities. Every year, a number
                          of our faculty members gets higher education and
                          short-term scientific and research training in well
                          reputed International universities. Our highly
                          qualified faculty members have tremendous potential to
                          change the traditional way of thinking about
                          engineering education, pedagogy and research
                          excellence. Our faculty members are conducting
                          research in the core areas of electrical engineering,
                          electronics, computer engineering, communication
                          engineering and biomedical engineering, and laudable
                          outcomes are often appraised at home and abroad. The
                          faculty fosters future scientists and engineers and
                          aims at developing not only the ability in students to
                          live flexibly and aggressively in our rapidly changing
                          society, but also at producing scientists and
                          engineers with fundamental academic skills to advance
                          our modern way of life. It is our mission to develop
                          professionals with a global perspective and who take
                          an active role in international progress. Our students
                          already proved their merits and endeavors in home and
                          abroad by securing the top positions in their
                          respective fields and we hope to offer furthering its
                          continuation. So as you browse our new web site, I
